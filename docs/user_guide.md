# User Guide: Nimo Platform

## Introduction

Nimo is a decentralized platform that allows African youth to create verifiable digital identities and earn reputation tokens for their real-world contributions. This guide explains how to use the platform.

## Getting Started

### Creating Your Identity

To create your identity on Nimo:

```

### Recording Your Contributions

Once you have an identity, you can record your contributions:

1. Add a contribution with details of what you did
2. Provide evidence or metadata about your contribution
3. Seek verification from a trusted organization

Example in MeTTa:
```
(add-contribution "YourName" "Community Cleanup Event")
(add-contribution-with-metadata "YourName" "Youth Workshop" "Taught 20 students Python basics")
```
