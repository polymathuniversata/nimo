# Frontend Development Sync with Aisha
**Updated: August 26, 2025 - MeTTa Backend Integration Complete**

## ðŸš€ **MAJOR UPDATE: Backend Ready for Frontend Integration**

Hi Aisha,

**BIG NEWS**: The MeTTa AI integration is now **COMPLETE and OPERATIONAL**! ðŸŽ‰

The backend is running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` with full MeTTa-powered contribution verification, fraud detection, and token calculation. This means you now have all the backend APIs you need to build the frontend.

## **Your Frontend Ownership & Responsibilities**

### **ðŸŽ¯ You Own 100% of Frontend Development**
- **Complete ownership** of `/frontend` directory
- **All Vue.js/Quasar components** and user interface code  
- **Web3 client-side integration** (wallet connections, transactions)
- **User experience design** and mobile responsiveness
- **Frontend testing** and deployment

### **âœ… Ready-to-Use Backend APIs** (John's completed work)

### Current Implementation Status

#### Completed:
- Basic project structure with Vue.js 3 and Quasar
- Router configuration with main pages
- Initial wallet integration with MetaMask/Base network
- Authentication UI screens
- Service layer structure

#### In Progress:
- Web3 wallet functionality (connection, network switching)
- Base UI components and layouts
- API integration with backend services

#### Not Started:
- Identity creation and NFT minting flow
- Contribution submission with evidence upload
- Token dashboard and transaction history
- Impact bond marketplace interface
- Comprehensive testing

## Key Focus Areas

Based on our implementation plans, I suggest we prioritize these areas:

### 1. Complete Wallet Integration

The `WalletConnect.vue` component and `wallet.js` store have the basic structure in place, but we need to enhance:

- Error handling for wallet connection failures
- Network switching UX (especially for Base network)
- Transaction signing and confirmation UI
- Support for multiple wallet providers

### 2. Identity Management Flow

We need to implement:
- Profile creation form with skill selection
- NFT minting integration with NimoIdentity contract
- Identity verification status display
- Profile editing and updating

### 3. Contribution System

The contribution system needs:
- Submission form with evidence upload to IPFS
- Contribution listing with filtering and search
- Verification status tracking
- Token award notification system

## Backend Integration Points

I've made progress on the backend side that you can integrate with:

### Smart Contract ABIs

The contract ABIs are available for integration:
- `NimoIdentity.sol` - For identity NFT and contribution tracking
- `NimoToken.sol` - For reputation token functionality

You can find these in the `contracts/` directory. I've deployed them to Base Sepolia testnet with these addresses:

```
NimoIdentity: 0x...
NimoToken: 0x...
```

### API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are ready for integration:

#### Authentication:
- POST `/api/auth/login` - User login
- POST `/api/auth/register` - User registration

#### User/Profile:
- GET `/api/user/profile` - Get user profile
- PUT `/api/user/profile` - Update user profile

#### Contributions:
- GET `/api/contributions/user` - Get user contributions
- POST `/api/contributions` - Create new contribution
- GET `/api/contributions/{id}` - Get specific contribution
- POST `/api/contributions/{id}/verify` - Verify contribution

#### Tokens:
- GET `/api/tokens/balance` - Get token balance
- GET `/api/tokens/transactions` - Get transaction history

#### Bonds:
- GET `/api/bonds/active` - Get active bonds
- POST `/api/bonds` - Create new bond
- GET `/api/bonds/{id}` - Get specific bond
- POST `/api/bonds/{id}/invest` - Invest in bond

## Testing Coordination

I suggest we coordinate on testing with:

1. **Component Testing**
   - Create tests for shared components first
   - Focus on wallet integration testing
   - Test form validation and submission

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Weekly integration sessions (Fridays)
   - Test contract interactions on Base Sepolia
   - Test API integration with mock data

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: MetaMask Base Network Integration
**Solution:** I've implemented Base network detection and auto-switching in the wallet store. You can use the `switchToBaseNetwork()` method to prompt users to switch networks.

### Challenge 2: Transaction Signing
**Solution:** The wallet store provides a `signMessage()` method for authentication and a `sendTransaction()` method for contract interactions.

### Challenge 3: IPFS Evidence Upload
**Solution:** I'm implementing an IPFS service in the backend. For frontend, we'll need a file upload component that can handle multiple files and track upload progress.

## Next Steps

1. Let's schedule a walkthrough of the existing code and discuss component assignments
2. Agree on which UI components to prioritize next
3. Set up a shared component testing strategy
4. Schedule regular integration testing sessions

Looking forward to your feedback and continuing our collaboration on the frontend implementation!

Best,
John
