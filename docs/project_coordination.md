- Get best practice recommendations
- Access latest OpenZeppelin patterns
- Validate security implementations

### Claude Desktop Configuration
Add to MCP configuration:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "OpenZeppelinContracts": {
      "type": "stdio", 
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@openzeppelin/contracts-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Contingency: Upgrade mechanisms and emergency pause

**Web3 Integration Issues:**
- Mitigation: Multiple wallet support and fallback options
- Contingency: Traditional auth backup for critical features

**MeTTa Performance:**
- Mitigation: Caching and optimization strategies
- Contingency: Manual verification fallback system

### Project Risks
**Scope Creep:**
- Solution: Weekly scope reviews and priority alignment
- Escalation: Feature parking lot for post-launch

**Integration Delays:**
- Solution: Daily integration testing
- Contingency: Fallback implementations for complex features

**Resource Constraints:**
- Solution: Pair programming and knowledge sharing
- Escalation: External contractor support if needed

This coordination guide ensures John and Aisha can work efficiently together while building a robust, secure, and user-friendly decentralized identity platform.
