# üö® NIMO Repository Status - Urgent Action Required

## Current Situation (August 27, 2025)

**Repository has been cleaned up and consolidated to 2 branches:**
- `development` (active branch with full frontend)
- `main` (stable reference branch)

## What Happened

1. **Branch Cleanup**: Removed 4 unnecessary branches (`frontend-update`, `backup-frontend-migration-20250827-162551`)
2. **Frontend Migration**: Completed migration from `client/` to root directory structure
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Merged changes and kept the full-featured frontend

## Your Partner's Current Status

**Your `frontend-update` branch exists on remote but:**
- Contains simplified version (removed many components)
- Has 1 commit: "re-writted"
- Is significantly behind the main development work

## Immediate Action Required

### Step 1: Fetch Latest Changes (SAFE)
```bash
git fetch origin
```

### Step 2: See What's New
```bash
git log --oneline origin/development -5
git diff origin/frontend-update origin/development --stat
```

### Step 3: Choose Your Path

#### Option A: Switch to Full Version (Recommended)
```bash
git checkout -b my-development origin/development
# Work on this full-featured version
```

#### Option B: Merge Your Changes
```bash
git checkout frontend-update
git merge origin/development  # Will have conflicts!
```

#### Option C: Create Compromise
```bash
git checkout -b compromise
git merge origin/development
# Manually restore what you need
```

## Key Differences

**Your partner's development branch has:**
- ‚úÖ Complete frontend migration
- ‚úÖ All components (Contributions, Profile, Skills, UserCard, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Full user management system
- ‚úÖ Latest backend integrations

**Your frontend-update branch has:**
- ‚ùå Removed many components
- ‚ùå Simplified user context
- ‚ùå Different approach

## Recommendation

**Switch to the full development branch** - it has more features and is ahead in development.

## Time Sensitive

**We have limited time** - please fetch and review changes immediately, then choose your approach.
